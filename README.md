## Introduction
This project uses the Iris dataset from the `sklearn.datasets` module to demonstrate basic data analytics principles. The tasks include:
- Loading the dataset.
- Exploring its structure (e.g., shape, feature names, and target classes).
- Summarizing the data with statistical measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.

The goal is to provide a foundational understanding of data exploration and analysis techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- Libraries:
  - `scikit-learn` for dataset loading and machine learning tools.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.

## Tasks Overview
### Task 1: Source the Data Set
- Import the `sklearn.datasets` module.
- Load the Iris dataset using the `load_iris()` function.

### Task 2: Explore the Data Structure
- Print the shape of the dataset to understand its dimensions.
- Display the first and last 5 rows of the data to preview the dataset.
- Print the feature names and target classes to understand the dataset's structure.

### Task 3: Summarize the Data
- Calculate and display the following statistics for each feature:
  - Mean
  - Minimum
  - Maximum
  - Standard Deviation
  - Median
